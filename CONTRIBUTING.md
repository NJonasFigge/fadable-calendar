## Commit Message Rules

- Avoid vague adjectives like: enhanced, better, improved, adjust, handling, streamline
- Start the message in lowercase
- Keep it short
- Prefer concrete descriptions:
  - WHAT changed
  - WHY it changed
- Use imperative mood ("fix", "add", "remove")
- Reference affected module or behavior
